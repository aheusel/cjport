- Create standard unix routines like memcopy etc.
- Possibility to cast from pubyte to pfloat. Needs major restructuring of pointer-foundation.
- double and triple pointer classes: ppuint, pppuint
- 64-bit pointers: No garbage-collection for sun.misc.Unsafe, use pageing instead
- const-pointer interface?
